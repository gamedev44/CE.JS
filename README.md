Cymatics Engine 3D (CE.js)
üåü Features
Real-time 3D Particle System: Simulates tens of thousands of particles smoothly in a 3D space using three.js.

Complex Wave Shaping: Utilizes multi-axis frequency modulation (XY and Z axes) to generate intricate, three-dimensional patterns from simple wave functions.

Advanced Physics Controls: Manipulate global forces such as center-point gravity, rotational vortex forces, and system-wide damping.

Inter-particle Interactions: Models both repulsion and cohesion forces to create more fluid, organic, and clustered particle behaviors.

Selectable Waveforms: Instantly switch between Sine, Square, Triangle, and Sawtooth waveforms to fundamentally alter the texture and structure of the patterns.

Built-in Presets: Includes a variety of curated presets to showcase the engine's capabilities, from atomic orbitals to galactic spirals.

Full Camera Control: Orbit, pan, and zoom to view your creations from any angle.

üïπÔ∏è Controls
The user interface is designed for experimentation and discovery.

Camera:

Rotate: Left-click and drag.

Zoom: Mouse wheel scroll.

Pan: Right-click and drag.

Frequency Sliders (XY Freq, Z Freq): These are the core of the pattern generation. They control the complexity of the shape along different spatial axes.

Physics Sliders (Amplitude, Gravity, etc.): These sliders control the forces acting upon the particles, influencing the energy, stability, and motion of the final shape.

Interaction Sliders (Repulsion, Cohesion): These control how particles react to each other, allowing for more liquid or clustered effects.

Get Camera State: Position your camera to the perfect viewing angle, then click this button to generate the camPos and camZoom data needed for a new preset.
