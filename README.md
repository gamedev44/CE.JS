# CE.JS
A dynamic volumetric particle field simulation engine. It subjects the field to user-defined, multi-axis resonant frequencies, generating emergent structures resembling Chladni figures and Adinkra symbology. This allows for the real-time sculpting of matter through the direct manipulation of wave mechanics via variable parameters.
